# wordy

This code is mostly just for fun. My gf and I enjoy word games (like Boggle), but having to reroll the board frequently to get a usable one is an annoyance. 

This code, when finished, will generate a board with a minimum number of 5+ letter words, ensuring a game where there are decent words to be found.

todos:
A lot. This is obviously nowhere near finished, but just a day or so of work.
Add representations for the letters and the ability for them to be rotated as to better mimic an actual Boggle board.
Finish shifting to using the Letter object instead of a string, mostly to enable the above.
Adjust tests for the move to Letter object.
Finish tests.
